\section{Todays systems} \label{sec:todays_systems}
Todays modern systems \cite{Gradebot} \cite{GenerationReview}  \cite{Kattis} \cite{Amelung} (considered to be third generation systems) commonly contain the following features:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A web based front-end.
	\item A general purpose back-end.
	\item A seperate back-end for each programming language the system supports (which is invoked by the general purpose back-end system).
	\item A database used to store submissions for later review by users and/or teachers.
	\item Sandboxing of submitted code to maintain a solid system state (avoids malicious code causing damage to the system). 
\end{itemize}
Between these modern systems they mainly differ in their support of programming languages.
