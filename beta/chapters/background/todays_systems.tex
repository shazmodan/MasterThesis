\section{Todays systems} \label{sec:todays_systems}
Todays modern systems, such as those in \cite{Gradebot} \cite{Suleman} \cite{GenerationReview}  \cite{Kattis} \cite{Amelung} (considered to be third generation systems), commonly contain a web based front-end together with a general back-end whos main purpose is to save submissions to the database and to send the submitted code (pipeline) to the other language specific back-ends (one for each language) while preserving system security through sandboxing. The database can be used to inspect specific submissions. The modern systems mainly differ in their support of different programming languages.
