\section{Todays systems} \label{sec:todays_systems}
Todays modern systems (ref Kattis)(ref p219-amelung)(ref p1-douce)(ISECON.2006) (considered to be third generation systems) commonly contain the following features:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A web based front-end.
	\item A language specific back-end.
	\item A seperate back-end for each programming language the system supports.
	\item An SQL database used to store submissions.
	\item Sandboxing of submitted code to maintain a solid system state. 
\end{itemize}
These systems mainly differ in their support for different programming languages.
