A common challenge for software consulting companies is recruiting the right people. In the software industry the recruitment process usually involves several steps before a contract is signed, a single job interview is rarely enough. Thus, the interview tends to involve some sort of test to make sure that the person seeking the position is qualified. The testing procedure is usually part of the interview or conducted at the same occasion. Interviewing applicants who aren't qualified enough for the position can be a waste of time. 

This waste can be minimized by only interviewing qualified applicants. In the software industry, qualifications are usually asserted by letting an applicant solve programming problems. This process can be automated using an Automatic Code Evaluation System / Automatic Grader. Such systems already exist on several universities today and are used extensively in several programming courses and programming contests.

This thesis evaluates such a system with regards to execution speed and memory consumption. It also explains how such a system can be built and how the different languages performed. The system is unique in the aspect that it's built using only Microsoft .NET Framework while still supporting multiple programming languages. The languages supported are C\#, Java and Python. This support is enabled through the use of a Java byte code to CIL compiler called IKVM and Python scripting is supported through the use of IronPython.

The results show that C\# and Java performs almost equally in terms of execution speed, with Java being slightly behind. Python seemed to have greater performance issues than the other two. Java consumed the most memory out of the three.

Future work involves testing more languages and improving the system with usability in mind.
