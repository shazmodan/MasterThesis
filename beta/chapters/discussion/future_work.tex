\section{Future Work}

Evaluating if other languages are suited for the .NET environment. Among these are, JavaScript using JavaScript.NET \cite{JavaScript.NET} or Jint \cite{Jint}, PHP using Phalanger \cite{Phalanger}, Ruby using IronRuby \cite{IronRuby}. There are many more languages that have a CLI implementation but basing on the current popularity of programming languages \cite{Tiobe} those are primarily the ones of interest.

CELINE can also be improved in many ways since the focus of this thesis was language compatibility and testing, rather than usability. An administrative web interface could be built along with better feedback on submissions. There is also a need to improve the handling of multiple concurrent users and evaluate how it affects performance.

There is also a need to improve the user interaction with the system (Human-Computer Interaction). This could be the subject of another Master Thesis perhaps.
