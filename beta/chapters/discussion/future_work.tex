Evaluating if other languages are suited for the .NET environment. Among these are, JavaScript using JavaScript.NET \cite{JavaScript.NET} or Jint \cite{Jint}, PHP using Phalanger \cite{Phalanger}, Ruby using IronRuby \cite{IronRuby}. There are many more languages that have a CLI implementation but based on the current popularity of programming languages \cite{Tiobe} those are primarily the ones of interest.

CELINE can also be improved in many ways since the focus of this thesis was language compatibility and testing, rather than usability. An administrative web interface could be built along with better feedback on submissions. Energy can also be spent on usability testing in order to improve the user experience.
