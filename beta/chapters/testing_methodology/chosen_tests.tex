\section{The chosen tests}
The tests are a mixture of general functionality and two specific algorithms.

\subsection{Language overhead}
Each programming language has an overhead startup cost measured in time. This is measured by submitting code which does the minimum given this context. In Figure \ref{fig:minimum_code} a minimum code block for the C\# programming language is demonstrated.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\lstset{style=sharpc}
	\begin{lstlisting}
	public class OverheadTest{
		public string SimpleReturn(string input){
			return "";
		}
		public static void Main(){}
	}
	\end{lstlisting}
	\caption{C\# code which returns an empty string.}
