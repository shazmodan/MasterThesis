\subsubsection{Merge Sort}

Figure \ref{fig:net_merge_sort} illustrates the time it takes for each language, run in the .NET environment, to sort one million randomly generated positive integers in ascending order.

	\caption{This test was run in the .NET environment and used the Merge sort algorithm to sort one million elements in ascending order. A lower value is better. Note that the vertical axis is base 10 logarithmic. C\# was the fastest with 0.759 seconds. Java came in second with 0.967 seconds. Python was the slowest with 71.663 seconds.}

Figure \ref{fig:net_merge_sort_memory} illustrates the amount of MB of memory used when running the merge sort algorithm in the .NET environment by the different languages. C\# and Java are almost equal while Python uses more memory.
