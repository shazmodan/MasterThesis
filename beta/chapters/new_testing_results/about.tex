\section{Testing Procedure}
All tests presented in this chapter were run on both computers. The ratios on the Windows 8 computer were close to the OSX computer running Parallels and Bootcamp. The small differences in the results between the two machines are likely due to pure variance. The test results should be viewed in relative terms and not in absolute terms.

While the best time is the only time presented in this chapter, the mean-time was also recorded to make sure that the best time was not just a one-time fluke (which could have depended on unknown factors).

Every test was run 100 times on each computer in order to reduce variance. All results were adjusted according to the overhead for each language (see section \ref{subsec:language_overhead}). The input for each test varies from 1000 elements up to 10 million elements. The elements are randomly generated positive integers.

All tests in the Java and .NET environments were run with disabled debug flags to optimize performance.
