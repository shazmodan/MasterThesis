\subsubsection{Insertion Sort}

Figure \ref{fig:native_insertion_sort} illustrates the time it takes for each language to sort 10'000 randomly generated positive integers in ascending order. Note the severe time differences between Python and the other languages.

	\caption{This test uses the Insertionsort algorithm to sort 10'000 elements in ascending order. Lower is better. Please note that the vertical axis is base 10 logarithmic. Java is the fastest with 0.015 seconds while Python is the slowest with 4.191 seconds. }
