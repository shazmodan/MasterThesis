\section{Results}
In this section, the results are presented using tables and charts. Note that on some charts the vertical axis is base 10 logarithmic (for viewing purposes). The implementation of all the algorithms for all languages can be found in Appendix \ref{appendix:code}.

\subsection{Native environments}
This section display the results for the tests made in each language native environment. As is illustrated in each subsection, these tests tend to do better performance wise than the corresponding tests in the .NET environment.

\subsection{.NET environment}
This section display the results for the tests made in each language when run in the .NET environment. The tests tend to perform poorer performance wise than the corresponding tests in the native environment.
