\subsubsection{Insertion Sort}

Figure \ref{fig:net_insertion_sort} illustrates the time it takes for each language, run in the .NET environment, to sort 10'000 randomly generated positive integers in ascending order.

	\caption{This test was run in the .NET environment and used the Insertion sort algorithm to sort 10'000 elements in ascending order. Lower is better. Note that the vertical axis is base 10 logarithmic. C\# was the fastest with 0.087 seconds. Java was a close second with 0.114 seconds. Python was the worst with 9.36 seconds.}
