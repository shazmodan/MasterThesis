\section{Goal}
The main goal was to evaluate a system which could satisfy the demands stated above. Thus, since no such system was present at Valtech, there was a need to build the system and then evaluate it through test cases with performance and memory consumption in mind.

The system would allow users to submit solutions to common programming problems and then have their code evaluated. Their code would have to have a limit on execution time since a ``good'' programmer should be able to solve problems efficiently. The results of the evaluation would be used to estimate how much time the different programming languages would need in order to solve problems as all of these languages would be run in the Microsoft .NET Platform and some are expected to perform better than others.
