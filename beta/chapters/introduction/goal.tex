\section{Goal}
The main goal was to evaluate a system which could satisfy the demands stated above. Thus, since no such system was present at Valtech, there was a need to build the system and then evaluate it through test cases with performance and memory consumption in mind.

The system would allow users to submit solutions to common programming problems and then have their code evaluated. Their code would have to have a limit on execution time since a ``good'' programmer should be able to solve problems efficiently, particularly common university style algorithms such as sorting. The results of the evaluation would be used to estimate a scaling factor between these languages in order to make it possible for users to compete against each other for the fastest execution times on the leaderboards. The scaling factor is necessary due to the fact that all of these languages would be run under the Microsoft .NET framework and some are expected to perform better than others.
