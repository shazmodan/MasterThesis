\section{Problem Statement}
A common challenge for Valtech and other consulting companies is to recruit the right people.  The recruitment process in the IT business often involves several steps and can be very time consuming. This is due to the fact that knowledge and skill differ greatly from programmer to programmer and therefore a need to interview many people arises (just to find one that is deemed suitable for the job). 

The recruitment process usually involves some kind of test to assert the skill of the programmer. The test is sometimes performed on paper (questionnaire) or on a white board. Both of these environments aren't really suitable to program in, hence most programmers tend to do their work on computers with the assistance of a web browser and a suitable IDE. 

These two issues present a challenge in which the optimal solution would result in less time spent recruiting and at the same time asserting the skills of the programmers before an interview is considered.
