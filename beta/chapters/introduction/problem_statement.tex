\section{Problem Statement}
A common challenge for Valtech and other consulting companies is to recruit the right people. The recruitment process in the IT business often involves several steps and can be time consuming. This is because knowledge and skill can differ significantly from programmer to programmer and a need to interview many people arises (just to find one that is deemed suitable for the job).

The recruitment process usually involves some test to assert the skill of the programmer. A test which usually contains one or several programming problems. The test is sometimes performed on paper (questionnaire) or a white board. Both of these environments are not suitable for programming, hence most programmers tend to do their work on computers with the assistance of a web browser and a suitable IDE.

The testing process is particularly common when it comes to the recruitment of recently graduated university students. On universities, the efficiency of the implementation of certain algorithms are of great importance for the students since they are sometimes graded with this in mind.

These issues present a challenge. The optimal solution would result in less time spent recruiting and at the same time asserting the skills of the programmers before an interview is considered.
