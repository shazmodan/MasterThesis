\chapter*{Foreword}

This report is my Master Thesis project which was carried out at Valtech in Stockholm, Sweden. This thesis is part of my last course in the Masters Programme in Computer Science at The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). The most difficult part of this thesis was finding out what subject to research. Then one day some words from my supervisor Alexander Baltatzis echoed in my head from one of his lectures ``Write code in any language and run it in .NET''. That sentence sparked my interest in finding out whether it was actually possible or not, since most people who write programs on the .NET platform do so using C\# or Visual Basic, you barely ever hear about someone using any other language (even though many others are supported by the .NET platform).
