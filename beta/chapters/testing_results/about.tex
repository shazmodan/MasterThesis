\section{Testing procedure}
All tests presented in this chaper were run on both computers (section \ref{sec:system_specs}). Test results show that the machine running Windows 8 natively is 2-3 times slower on every test, this seems to be hardware related. Due to this fact, the results from the native Windows computer will not be presented in this thesis. The results presented in this chapter are from the computer running OSX and should not be interpreted in absolute numerical values but rather in relative terms (which is why some tables contain a ratio column). The ratios on the native Windows 8 computer were very similar to the OSX computer running Windows 7 under Parallels, the differences are mostly likely due to variance.

While the best time is the only time presented in this chapter, the mean-time was also recorded to make sure that the best time was not just a one time fluke (which could have depended on unknown factors). All tests were run 100 times on each computer in order to reduce variance while measuring. All results were adjusted according to the overhead for each language.
