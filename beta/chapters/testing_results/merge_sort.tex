Since the runtime for Python was already over the one minute mark with just 100'000 elements (see Table \ref{table:merge_sort}) I decided not to test one million elements with Python. Instead I tested C\# and Java with one million elements and compared the runtimes with one hundred thousand elements in Figure \ref{fig:merge_sort_csharp_java}.

As Table \ref{table:merge_sort} illustrates, the ratio for Python seemed to get worse and worse in relation to the number of elements sorted.

C\# still outperforms Java when run under the .NET environment. But the gap between them seemed to narrow the more elements were added. I attempted to run Java under its native environment, and it  outperformed C\# (see Figure \ref{fig:merge_sort_csharp_java_native}). 

Java run under .NET is about equal to C\# when it comes to memory management as seen in Figure \ref{fig:merge_sort_memory}.
