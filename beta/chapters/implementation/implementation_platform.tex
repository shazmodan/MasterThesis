\section{Implementation platform}
There are many different application virtualization machine implementations today. Among the more popular ones are the CLR/Mono (C\#, C++/CLI, F\#, VB.NET, IronPython, IronRuby and others), CPython (Python), HHVM (PHP, Hack), the JVM (Java, Jython, Groovy, JRuby, C, C++, Clojure, Scala and others), the Perl virtual machine (Perl) and Rubinius (Ruby). Based on programming language popularity when this thesis was written \cite{Tiobe} the choice came down to either the CLR or the JVM. While the JVM supports more languages than the CLR, it was not the deciding factor since there wasn't enough time to implement more than three languages. Because of these time constraints the choice of using the CLR was based on the authors proficiency with Microsoft Visual Studio (with ReSharper).
