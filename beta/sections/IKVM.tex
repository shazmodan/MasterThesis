\subsection{What is IKVM.NET?}
IKVM.NET is an implementation of Java for Mono and the Microsoft .NET Framework. It includes the following components:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A Java Virtual Machine implemented in .NET
	\item A .NET implementation of the Java class libraries
	\item Tools that enable Java and .NET interoperability
\end{itemize}

It also includes (among other things) a Java bytecode to .NET IL translator, which is what this project used.

\subsection{Implementation}
To achieve Java compatability, this project takes a Java codefile as input, compiles this to Java bytecode using the standard Oracle Java programming language compiler and then uses the IKVM compiler to translate the newly generated bytecode into .NET IL.
