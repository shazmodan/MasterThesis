In this chapter the history of automatic code evaluation is explored.

\section{History of automatic code evaluation}
Evaluating code automatically is nothing new. The earliest known system was built in 1960 by Hollingsworth (referens Hollingsworth). This system was used in an introductory course in Algol programming. The results from using this student-system approach rather than the traditional student-teacher was that it cut costs considerably for the staff since the time they needed to grade the students work was reduced by as much as one third. The students themselves also spent less time, since they could submit their work immidiately when it was finished instead of waiting for a teacher. This system also made it possible to considerably increase the number of students taking the course.
